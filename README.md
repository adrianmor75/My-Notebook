This is a Exercise to Evaluete my progress in the first lesson about use Phyton. Create a Notebook 
and upload to github
#!/usr/bin/env python
# coding: utf-8

# # Data Science Tool and Ecosystem

# In this Notebook, Data Science and Ecosystem are Summarized. 
# In this lab it will use the markdown cells in order to summarized the differents tools using in data science and how the 
# ecosystem works.

# Some of the popular languages that Data Science use are:
# 1. Phyton
# 2. R
# 3. SQL
# 4. Scala
# 5. Julia
# 6. Java
# 7. C++

# The most common libraries use in Data Science are:
# * Panda
# * Matplotlib
# * Scikit-learn
# * TensorFlow
# * Pytorch
# * Apach Spark
# * Numpy
# * Scala
#   

# ## **Objectives**
# * Create one column table
# * Make different exercise to create a Jupyter Notebook
# * Practice different ways to creat text with markdown cells
# * Use code cells with arithmetic operations

# ## Data Science Tools
# | Data Science Tools |
# |--------------------|
# | MySQL|
# | PostgresSQL|
# | MongoDB|
# |Apache AirFlow|
# |KubeFlow|

# ### Below are few examples of evaluatin arithmetic expressions in Phyton

# In[1]:


3+5


# In[2]:


-9+8-7-21+38


# In[4]:


-5*2+(-7/17)


# #### Exercise 8 Code exercise

# In[5]:


'This is a simple arithmetic expresion to multiply then add integers'
(3*4)+5


# #### Converting minutes  to hours

# In[6]:


'This will convert 200 minutes to hours by dividing by 60'
200/60
